# Competitive Programming Setup

This folder contains files used for competitive programming in C++.

I use **GCC** installed via **Homebrew** on macOS.

This setup uses [bits/stdc++.h](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/master/libstdc++-v3/include/precompiled/stdc++.h), which is part of GCC’s C++ standard library.

On macOS, the file is usually located at:

```text
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/gcc/<version>/include/c++/<version>/bits/stdc++.h
